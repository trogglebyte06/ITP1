            <b>AMBIGUITY:</b>
            A phenomenon in spoken language allowing a speaker to be understood by fellow humans even when not saying everything perfectly.
            Ambiguity is not a luxury when communicating to a computer.
            Computers will only carry out instructions exactly as written.
            Be careful of typos, missing structural elements, etc.
            For this reason, computers are often lovingly said to be "stupid".
          </p>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>ATTRIBUTE:</b>
            A parameter required by some tags which provides additional information to a browser.
            This information is used by the browser to correctly render tag content in the html document.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id = "block">
          <p>
            <b>BLOCK:</b>
            A quality of certain tags.
            Tags are said to be block tags when they create an invisible box around content with height and width.
            These invisible boxes can be manipulated in various ways to stylize a webpage.
            We will learn more about this in subsequent lessons.

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>BROWSER:</b>
            A tool used to communicate with servers to view hosted files.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>DOCUMENT STRUCTURE:</b>
            Document Structure refers to additional coding needed to make a functional webpage.
            Now that we use html4, building the frame of an html document is much simpler.
            Document Structure should also bring to mind the concept of indentation.
            When coding, lines of code are indented to make it easier for colleagues to read and interpret.
            Indentation can also make it easier for a programmer to identify errors in their own code.

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>DOCUMENTATION:</b>
            Documentation exists to assist developers when writing code.
            It is easily found online through a <a href="www.google.com">google</a> search.
            Thanks to documentation it isn't necessary to memorize every html tag.
            Even professional developers refer to documentation and other online resources on a daily basis to get the job done.
            The most important skill of a programmer is the ability to creatively solve abstract problems.
            This is not a memorized skill.

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>HTML:</b>
            Hyper Text Markup Language is a language used to write documents which appear on the internet.
            html documents are the most common form of document on the internet.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>HTTP:</b>
            The language that browsers and servers use to communicate and transfer information over the internet.
          <p>
        </div>

        <div id = "inline">
          <p>
            <b>INLINE:</b>
            A quality of certain tags.
            Tags are said to be inline when the content they markup is seen inline with other content around it.
            See also: <a href = "#block"> BLOCK </a>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>INTERNET, THE:</b>
            The largest computer network in the world.
            Invented in the early 90s.
            Composed of 30 Billion html pages.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>SERVER:</b>
            A computer especially designed to host files which it makes available to browsers upon request.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>TAG:</b>
            A tag is an html operator which is used to manipulate text, images, videos, and other file types on an HTML document.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>VOID:</b>
            A tag is said to be void when no content is required between opening and closing tags.
            Consequently, no &lt;/tag&gt; is needed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>WHITESPACE:</b>
            The blank spaces between words and paragraphs in a webpage.
            It should be noted that just because a line is started
            in the text editor does not mean that a new line will
            appear in the webpage. For whitespace to appear in the
            webpage certain tags must be added. See the section below
            on tags for more information about which tags can be
            used to add whitespace to a document.

                Most tags take extra parameters in the opening tag called attributes which provide additional information to the browser.
                Many tags take multiple attributes.
                Note that some tags are said to be void and do not use a closing tag and contain no content (even tags that take multiple attributes).
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              Examples:
              <div>
                The anchor tag for hyperlinks:
                <pre>
                  &lt;a href = "google.com"&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt; = <a href = "google.com">google.com</a>
                </pre>
                The image tag for inserting hyperlinks to an html document is a void tag and has multiple attributes:
                <pre>
                  &lt;img src = "https://reallylongurl.com" alt = "SMILE!"&gt; = <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ec/13/a7/ec13a753972c254761be4d9d5666d341.jpg" width = "17.5" height = "16.5" alt="SMILE!">

              <p>
                The existence and ready accessibiliy of documentation means (thankfully) that memorizing all of the tags and all of the attributes for every tag is not necessary.
                You are better off using your brain power to understand the broad concepts and hone your problem solving abilities.
                Most documentation can be found with a simple google search.
                Additional resources can be found in online forums.

                It is important to remember that line breaks in the text editor do not translate to line breaks on the html document.
                Multiple spaces in the text editor become only one space in the html document.
                New lines are only displayed in the html document if the proper coding is implemented.
                When a new line is needed, there are a variety of tags available for use.
                Which tag you should use in any given instance depends on how you want your document to be structured.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              Examples:
              <div>
                The line break tag, an inline tag. This tag is also void, note that there is no closing tag needed.
                <pre>
                  &lt;br&gt;
                </pre>
                The paragraph tag, creates a different kind of line break involving a block.
                <pre>
                  &lt;p&gt;content&lt;/p&gt;
                </pre>

          <b>BLOCK VS INLINE</b>
          <div>
            <p>
              INLINE tags happen "inline" with the other stuff around it in the html document.
            </P>
          </div>
          <div>
            Examples:
            <div>
              <p>
                The image and line break tags (both seen above) are great examples of inline tags.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              BLOCK tags put an invisible box around the content it contains.
              This box has height and width and can be manipulated in various ways.
            </p>
            <div>
              Example:
              <div>
                The paragraph tag seen above is a great example of a block tag.
                See it explicitly in action below.
                <div>
                  <pre>
                    <p>&lt;p&gt;here's one block&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                    <p>&lt;p&gt;here's another&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                  </pre>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                There will be more to come on what you can do with inline and block tags in future lessons.

              Certain tags are needed to build the frame around an html document.
              The frame won't change much in this course.
              Suffice it to say that these tags are needed for html to work correctly.
            </p>
            <div>
              Example:
              <div>
                <pre>
                  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                    &lt;html&gt;
                      &lt;head&gt;
                        &lt;title&gt;Title!&lt;title&gt;
                      &lt;/head&gt;
                      &lt;body&gt;
                        &lt;b&gt;<b>Content!</b>&lt;/b&gt;
                      &lt;/body&gt;
                    &lt;html&gt;
                </pre>

            </div>
            <p>
              Note that indentation is crucial to legible code.
              See above that the html element above has two child elements, head and body, which are indented the same amount.
              This indentation rule should apply to all parts of your code.
              Readable code makes it easier for colleagues to read your code and understand its function.
              Readable code makes it easier for you, the coder, to go back and troubleshoot problems that come up.
              Indentation is considered a best practice in the world of computer science generally speaking.

              Tags are the basic unit of "speech" in the HTML language. Some tags are used to form blocks to structure a webpage.
              These blocks can be nested and allow elements of a webpage to be placed and programmed to function with precision.
